Final project Computer Vision course - classify fonts
Grade: 100
Model Accuraccy: 95%

How to run the program:
I recommend to use google colab to view the project for convenience, but you can also use jupyter notebook.

Make sure you have the all the files in the main folder: "SynthText_train.h5", "SynthText_test.h5" 
(in the computer or in the main folder of your google drive account).

All the preprocessing made in the ipynb files.

If you wish to get the output excel result you need to run the file "main.py", and install all the required libraries:
tensorflow, json, h5py, numpy, python-opencv, PIL, pandas.
also make sure the you have model folder that contains the files: "model.hdf5", "model.json", "letters_probabilty.json".
